- 👋 Hi, I’m Dawid :)
- 👀 Passionate about beautiful, modern web design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JS frameworks like Vue, React and js runtime - Node.
- 💞️ I'm teacher and privately lucky husband and father of four sons. 
- 📫 Once my teacher said that if I want to be happy I have to study until my death, so since then I have been following the principle of self-development.
